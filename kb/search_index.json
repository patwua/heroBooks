They are most effective for  recurring  or  predictable  payments (utilities, mobile top-ups, bank charges) and  small cash-like receipts  (till deposits). Start with suggestions, then graduate to auto-post for truly stable patterns. \n Designing precise rules (GYD examples) \n \n  Identify a stable pattern : e.g., statements with “GTT TOPUP” in the description and amounts between  G$1,000–G$10,000 .   \n  Conditions :  contains: &quot;GTT&quot;  and  contains: &quot;TOPUP&quot; ; amount  between   1000–10000 .   \n  Outcome : Account  “Phone &amp; Internet” , VAT  Exempt  (telecom top-ups) or as per invoice; payee  GTT ;  suggest only  for the first month.   \n  Fuel : Description contains “SHELL” or “GUYOIL”; amount  2,000–30,000  → Account  “Fuel” , VAT  14%  (if documented), payee set;  no auto-post  if receipts often include shop items (split need"
