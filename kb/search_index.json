Two show “0%” for exported items; one shows “Exempt — financial service”. – Zero-rated: confirm export docs; label “0% (Schedule 1)” and amounts in GYD. – Exempt: check service qualifies; ensure no input VAT claim on that purchase. – Recompute VAT for VAT-inclusive invoice G$114,000: output VAT = 114,000 × 14/114 = 14,000; net sales 100,000. \n Illustration \n \n Figure: see /public/kb/illustrations/vat-invoice-audit.svg (1:1) \n \n"

You still treat it as VAT-able; typically you may  recover input VAT  on related purchases, and zero-rated sales count toward refund claims if they dominate your outputs. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}   \n  Exempt  =  non-taxable . You do  not  charge VAT; related input VAT is  not recoverable  (unless you operate a partial-exemption method for mixed supplies). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} \n \n \n Guyana’s standard VAT rate is 14% (used for standard-rated items; not for zero-rated or exempt).
