This page covers G$ entries and checks. For regional policy & calculator CSV, see `kb/articles/payroll-leave-policy-templates-caribbean.md`.

## G$ journals
Monthly accrual: Dr Staff costs — leave accrual / Cr Accrued expenses.  
When taken: Dr Accrued expenses / Cr Wages (or leave payable).  
Termination payout: Dr Accrued expenses / Cr Bank.

## Reconciliation
Use a leave ledger per employee: opening + accruals − taken − payouts = closing; verify against HR records.
