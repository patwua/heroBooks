This page is regional. For G$ entries, see `kb/articles/petty-cash-imprest-system-gyd.md`.

## Imprest basics
Set a fixed float; pay only small items from petty cash with vouchers; reimburse to restore the float based on approved vouchers.

## Controls
Lock the tin; assign a custodian; reconcile vouchers to cash‑on‑hand; require approvals; no IOUs.
