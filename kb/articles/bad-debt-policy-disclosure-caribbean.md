This page covers policy and disclosures. For entries and VAT, see `kb/articles/bad-debts-recoveries-journals-vat-guyana.md`.

## Policy basics
– Provision methodology (aging/ECL), review frequency, approval levels.  
– Write‑off criteria and documentation.  
– Recovery handling and VAT implications by jurisdiction.

## Example disclosure (short)
> The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables based on an aging provision matrix calibrated to historical loss experience and forward‑looking factors. During the year, bad‑debt expense of G$[x] was recognised; write‑offs of G$[y] were charged against the allowance.
