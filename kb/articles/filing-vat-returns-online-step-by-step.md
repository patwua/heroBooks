## Before you start
- Create/verify your **GRA e-Services** account and entity linkage. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Prepare the **VAT Summary** (outputs vs inputs) and supporting schedules. (heroBooks: Reports → VAT).  

## Steps (e-Services)
1) **Log in** to GRA e-Services and choose **Submit Return**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
2) Select **VAT** and **tax period**.  
3) Enter totals (**outputs, inputs, adjustments**) and **attach** required documents.  
4) **Submit**; you’ll receive on-screen status and email notifications as GRA processes the return. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

## Deadline & payments
- Returns are due by the **21st** of the month following the period (move to next business day if the 21st is a holiday). Plan earlier to avoid congestion. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

## Tips
- If you invoice **VAT-inclusive**, use the **7/57 VAT fraction** to back out the VAT when reconciling totals. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- Keep **Tax Invoices** compliant to support your inputs/outputs. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
