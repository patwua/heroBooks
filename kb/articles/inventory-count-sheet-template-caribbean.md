This page provides a regional count sheet template. For shrinkage and NRV write-down postings, see `kb/articles/inventory-counts-shrinkage-guyana.md`.

## CSV columns
`sku, description, bin, uom, counted_qty, system_qty, variance_qty, unit_cost, variance_value, counted_by, verified_by, notes`

## Tips for use
– Freeze movements; assign zones/bins; have a verifier sign off.  
– Investigate variances > threshold; record shrinkage or NRV write-downs as needed.  
– Keep signed sheets and reconciliation notes for audit trail.

**Download the CSV:** `/kb/templates/inventory-count-sheet-template.csv`
