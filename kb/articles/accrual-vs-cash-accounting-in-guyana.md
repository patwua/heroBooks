  - question: What’s the difference between accrual and cash?
    answer: Accrual recognises income/expenses when earned/incurred; cash when paid/received. Accrual is used for financial statements under IFRS for SMEs.
    type: definition
  - question: How does this affect VAT in Guyana?
    answer: VAT follows “time of supply” rules. You must issue Tax Invoices and, if pricing is VAT-inclusive, use the 7/57 fraction to back out VAT.
    type: faq
  - question: When is my VAT return due?
    answer: On or before the 21st of the following month (or next business day).

## Plain-English definitions
- **Accrual basis**: recognise revenue when it’s **earned** and expenses when **incurred** (even if cash moves later).  
- **Cash basis**: recognise only when **cash is received/paid**.  
Financial statements for SMEs are prepared on the **accrual basis**, per IFRS for SMEs.

## VAT (what trips teams up)
- Guyana VAT uses the **time of supply** (tax point) to determine when output VAT is due, not when cash hits your account.  
- For taxable (14% or 0%) supplies you must issue a **Tax Invoice** with the required particulars.  
- If you quoted **VAT-inclusive** prices, apply **7/57** to derive the VAT portion when reconciling.

## Worked mini-example (GYD)
You invoice a customer on **March 29** for **G$228,000 VAT-inclusive**; payment arrives **April 5**.  
- **Accrual**: recognise sales in **March**. Back-out VAT using 7/57 → VAT **G$28,000**, net sales **G$200,000**.  
- **Cash**: if you kept a separate cash-basis internal view, you’d show the receipt in **April** — but your VAT **output** is tied to the **time of supply/invoice**, not the cash date.  
- **Filing**: include the output in your **March** VAT return (due by the **21st** of April).

## Quick checks
1) Are your **Tax Invoices** complete (supplier details, description, totals, VAT shown/0-rated/exempt tagged)?  
2) If using VAT-inclusive pricing, did you apply the **7/57 fraction** for reconciliations?  
3) Do your **accrual financials** match your VAT period totals (time-of-supply), with cash timing explained in your bank recs?

## In heroBooks
- Sales, purchases, and journals are **double-entry** on an **accrual** ledger.  
- VAT reports align to **invoice/time-of-supply**.  
- Use the VAT Summary and the back-out helper (7/57) for inclusive prices.  
- You can still export **cash-basis** views for internal cashflow planning.
