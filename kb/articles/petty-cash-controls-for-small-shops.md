  - question: What’s the best petty-cash float size?
    answer: Just enough for typical week-to-week incidentals. Many small shops use G$5k–G$25k. Replenish to the cap after each reconciliation; don’t “top up” daily.
    type: faq
  - question: How do I reconcile petty cash?
    answer: Count the cash on hand + sum of approved vouchers/receipts + any IOUs. This should equal the float cap. Investigate any over/short immediately and document.

## Set the float and the rules
1) Float cap (example **G$15,000**). 2) Custodian (named person). 3) Use rules (e.g., ≤ G$3,000 per item, no wages, no loans). 4) Voucher with date, purpose, amount, requester + custodian signature. 5) Receipt required for every reimbursement.

## Reimburse and record
- Keep a small voucher book; number sequentially.  
- When reimbursing, attach the receipt and post to the proper expense (e.g., cleaning supplies).  
- Replenish to the cap via bank payment; post the summary to your ledger.

## Monthly reconciliation (5-step)
1. Count **cash on hand** (e.g., **G$2,400**).  
2. Sum **vouchers/receipts** since last replenishment (**G$12,600**).  
3. Confirm **cash + vouchers = float cap** (**2,400 + 12,600 = 15,000**).  
4. Post a journal to recognise the expenses if using periodic posting.  
5. Replenish from bank back to **G$15,000**.

Journal (summary): Dr Cleaning 6,000; Dr Snacks 3,200; Dr Stationery 3,400 / Cr Bank 12,600.  

## Controls that actually work
- Lockbox + limited key access; no mixing with till cash.  
- Weekly mini-counts by the custodian; **monthly surprise count** by someone else.  
- No split purchases to bypass limits.  
- Keep unused vouchers secure; investigate **over/short** on the spot.
