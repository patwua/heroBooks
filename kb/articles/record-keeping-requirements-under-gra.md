## Retention basics (Guyana)
Keep books and records for at least 8 years after the transaction is completed. For VAT, records must be in English, amounts expressed in Guyana dollars, and tax-invoicing rules apply (invoice/credit note sequences).

## What to file (starter list)
Sales: tax-invoices, Z-reports/daily sales, credit notes, contracts.  
Purchases: supplier invoices, import entries, duty/VAT slips.  
Banking: statements, deposit slips, merchant settlements.  
Payroll: PAYE schedules, NIS contributions, payslips.  
Fixed assets: invoices, capitalization support, disposal docs.  
General: ledgers, trial balances, management accounts, returns filed.

## A practical folder scheme
`/YYYY/01_January/...` with subfolders `Sales/`, `Purchases/`, `Bank/`, `Payroll/`, `VAT/`, `FixedAssets/`, `Other/`. File PDFs by YYYY-MM-DD_vendor_amount. Keep an index (CSV) for big months.

## Digital storage & backups
Scan paper, store read-only PDFs plus source files. Back up to a second location (cloud/drive) and test restores quarterly. Restrict delete rights; keep an audit trail for edits.

## VAT notes
– If you issue VAT-inclusive receipts, retain the calculation showing output VAT extracted (e.g., 7/57 fraction).  
– Keep evidence for zero-rated exports or special reliefs.
