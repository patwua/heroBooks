  - question: When do I write down inventory?
    answer: "When its net realisable value (expected selling price less costs to complete/sell) is below cost — recognise the loss in the period and carry inventory at NRV."

  - question: Can I reverse a write-down?
    answer: "Under IFRS/SMEs, yes — if NRV increases later, reverse up to the original write-down amount and recognise the reversal in profit or loss."

## What “lower of cost and NRV” means
Under IAS 2 and IFRS for SMEs Section 13, inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. NRV is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less costs to complete and sell. If NRV falls below cost, record a write-down; if NRV later increases, reverse the write-down (but not above original cost).

## G$ mini-scenario (write-down)
• 80 units on hand at G$1,200 cost = G$96,000.  
• Market softened; NRV per unit now G$1,120 → NRV total G$89,600.  
• Write-down = G$6,400.

Journal (recognition):  
Dr Cost of sales / Inventory write-down 6,400  
Cr Inventory 6,400

## Reversal when NRV recovers
Next month NRV improves to G$1,160 per unit (total G$92,800). The maximum reversal is G$3,200 (not above original cost).

Journal (reversal):  
Dr Inventory 3,200  
Cr Cost of sales 3,200

## Disclosures you should include
– Cost formula used (FIFO or weighted-average; IFRS does not permit LIFO).  
– Amount of any write-down recognised and reversed in the period.  
– The circumstances that led to write-downs or reversals.

## Controls & tips
– Run periodic NRV comparisons for slow-moving and seasonal stock.  
– Keep evidence for NRV (recent selling prices, offers, subsequent events).  
– Automate alerts for items priced below cost at POS.
