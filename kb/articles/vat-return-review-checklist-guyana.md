This page focuses on a pre‑filing checklist. For the variance bridge and 7/57 analysis, see `kb/articles/vat-return-variance-analysis-guyana.md`.

## Pre-filing checklist (tick through)
☐ **Period** is right; all sales/purchases posted to the correct month  
☐ **Tax invoices** captured: supplier & customer TINs, unique invoice no., date  
☐ **Rates** correct (14% / 0% / **exempt**) and **labelled** on invoices  
☐ **Math** checked: if prices are VAT-inclusive, extract **VAT = gross × 14/114 (7/57)**  
☐ **Zero-rated/exempt** support on file (Schedule/Act reference, export docs)  
☐ **Input VAT** only on VAT-qualifying purchases; exclude exempt purchases  
☐ **Box mapping** agrees to sales/purchase ledgers (and POS Z-reports)  
☐ **Bank payment** amount matches the return and falls before the **21st**  

## Quick reconciliation
1) Sales ledger VAT output vs summary of tax invoices.  
2) Purchases ledger VAT input vs supplier invoices/import entries.  
3) Tie to **trial balance** VAT control accounts.  
4) Investigate large **credit** positions (e.g., heavy zero-rated sales).

## Common errors to avoid
– Treating **exempt** purchases as input VAT claims.  
– Missing **inclusive** VAT extraction; overstating sales ex-VAT.  
– Wrong period: late-posted invoices or back-dated returns.
