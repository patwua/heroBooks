  - question: What are the classic cash schemes?
    answer: "**Skimming** (off-book theft before recording) and **larceny** (after recording: false voids/returns, short banking). Watch for unusual refunds, no-sale pops, and delayed deposits."
    type: definition
  - question: Which analytics should I run?
    answer: "ACFE-style tests like “high-refund clerks,” “late-night no-sales,” “voids near shift end,” and “deposit-to-Z report differences” by cashier and day."

## Behavioral red flags (watch patterns, not people)
Living beyond means; personal financial pressure; reluctance to share duties; unusual vendor/customer closeness. One flag alone isn’t proof — look for **clusters** and correlate with data. 

## Scheme patterns at the till
– Excess voids/returns; “no-sale” spikes; cancelled receipts re-issued at lower totals.  
– End-of-shift refunds without manager approval.  
– Deposits that don’t **match** Z-report cash; frequent “safe shortages.”

## Monthly analytics (quick start)
1) Rank **refund %** by cashier/day; review top outliers.  
2) Count **no-sales** by hour; investigate after-hours spikes.  
3) Compare **cash-to-deposit**; flag >G$500 deltas.  
4) List **same-customer, repeated returns**.  
5) Trace **voids** within 10 minutes of a sale (possible cancel/re-ring).

## Controls that help
Segregate refunds/void approvals; lock price overrides; require manager **PIN**; rotate cash-up duties; run **surprise counts**; maintain camera coverage of cash-up area.
