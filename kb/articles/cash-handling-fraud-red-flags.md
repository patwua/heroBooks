    type: definition
  - question: Which analytics should I run?
    answer: Tests like high-refund clerks, late-night no-sales, voids near shift end, and deposit-to-Z report differences by cashier and day.

## Behavioral red flags (watch patterns, not people)
Living beyond means; personal financial pressure; reluctance to share duties; unusual vendor/customer closeness. One flag alone is not proof - look for clusters and correlate with data.

## Scheme patterns at the till
- Excess voids/returns; "no-sale" spikes; cancelled receipts re-issued at lower totals.  
- End-of-shift refunds without manager approval.  
- Deposits that do not match Z-report cash; frequent "safe shortages".

## Monthly analytics (quick start)
1) Rank refund % by cashier/day; review top outliers.  
2) Count no-sales by hour; investigate after-hours spikes.  
3) Compare cash-to-deposit; flag >G$500 deltas.  
4) List same-customer, repeated returns.  
5) Trace voids within 10 minutes of a sale (possible cancel/re-ring).

## Controls that help
Segregate refunds/void approvals; lock price overrides; require manager PIN; rotate cash-up duties; run surprise counts; maintain camera coverage of cash-up area.
