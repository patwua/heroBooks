  - question: When do I expense vs capitalise a repair?
    answer: Expense routine servicing; capitalise replacements or upgrades that increase future benefits or extend useful life—then derecognise the replaced part.
    type: howto
  - question: Do I derecognise the old component?
    answer: Yes. When a significant part is replaced, remove the carrying amount of the old part from PPE and recognise the new part at cost.
    type: faq
  - question: Can I claim VAT on repairs/improvements?
    answer: If used to make taxable supplies, input VAT is generally recoverable; follow GRA rules (partial exemption if you have exempt outputs; special rules for zero-rated capital equipment).
    type: faq

## The rule in one minute
- **Expense** **day-to-day servicing** (e.g., oil, filters, minor fixes) — these keep the asset running but **do not** increase capacity or extend useful life. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- **Capitalise** **significant replacements or upgrades** that **extend useful life**, **increase capacity**, **improve quality**, or **reduce operating costs**; at the same time, **derecognise** the carrying amount of the part replaced. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

This “component approach” is explicit in IFRS (and carried into **IFRS for SMEs Section 17**). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Decision checklist (fast)
1) **What changed?** Routine upkeep → expense. New capability/longer life → consider capitalise. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
2) **Is it a significant component?** If yes and replaced, **capitalise new part** and **remove old**. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
3) **Materiality**: if immaterial, expense for practicality (document your policy).  
4) **VAT**: input VAT generally recoverable **only** if used for **taxable** supplies; apply **partial-exemption** if you have mixed supplies; note **special zero-rating** for certain capital equipment categories via GRA approvals. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Worked examples (GYD)

### A. Routine servicing (expense)
You service a delivery van (oil, filters, minor fixes) for **G$85,000 + VAT**.  
- **Dr Repairs & Maintenance** 85,000  
- **Dr VAT Input** 11,900 *(14%)*  
- **Cr Cash/Payables** 96,900  
Explanation: no extension of life/capacity → **expense**. VAT input recoverable if the van supports **taxable** operations (subject to partial exemption if you also make exempt supplies). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

### B. Major component replacement (capitalise + derecognise)
You replace a **production machine motor** for **G$420,000 + VAT**; the old motor’s **carrying amount is G$60,000**. The new motor improves throughput and life.  
- **Dr PPE – Machinery (new motor)** 420,000  
- **Dr VAT Input** 58,800  
- **Cr Cash/Payables** 478,800  
- **Dr Loss on Disposal (old component)** 60,000  
- **Cr PPE – Machinery (remove old motor)** 60,000  
Explanation: replacement **extends useful life/increases capacity** → **capitalise**; derecognise the old component’s carrying amount. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

### C. Upgrade that reduces operating cost (capitalise)
You retrofit **LED plant lighting** for **G$300,000 + VAT**, cutting energy use materially; no old component is separately identifiable.  
- **Dr PPE – Improvements** 300,000  
- **Dr VAT Input** 42,000  
- **Cr Cash/Payables** 342,000  
Explanation: the upgrade **improves future economic benefits** (lower costs) → **capitalise**; if no separable old component, no derecognition entry. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## Policy notes (what to write down)
- Define **capitalisation thresholds** (e.g., ≥ G$X) and examples per asset class.  
- State that **routine servicing is expensed**; **replacements/upgrades** are capitalised and **replaced parts derecognised**. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Require **evidence**: vendor docs describing the nature (service vs upgrade), asset IDs, and management approval.  
- Review **useful life, residual value, and method annually**; adjust **prospectively** if estimates change (don’t restate past depreciation). :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## VAT in Guyana (quick context)
- Input VAT is allowed on purchases **used to make taxable supplies**; where activities are **mixed** (taxable + exempt), use **partial-exemption** to restrict recovery proportionally. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- **Capital equipment** used in specified sectors may be **zero-rated** (by approval) under GRA **Policy 6**—follow the CG-letter process. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Keep **tax invoices** and link them to the asset/repair record for audits.

## In heroBooks
- Add the cost to the relevant **asset** (or **Repairs & Maintenance** for routine servicing).  
- Use the **component** fields or notes to show replacements and **link the derecognition** entry (old part) for a clean audit trail.  
- Depreciation will **recompute** from the new carrying amount over the revised remaining life.
