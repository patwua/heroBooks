This page covers entries and VAT adjustments. For policy/disclosures, see `kb/articles/bad-debt-policy-disclosure-caribbean.md`.

## G$ examples
– Provision: Dr Bad debt expense 50,000 / Cr Allowance 50,000.  
– Write‑off: Dr Allowance 30,000 / Cr Trade receivables 30,000.  
– Recovery later: Dr Bank 10,000 / Cr Recovery of bad debts (other income) 10,000.

## VAT note
If VAT bad‑debt relief applies, reduce output VAT when conditions are met (period elapsed, evidence of non‑recovery). Keep support and reverse relief if later recovered.

## Controls
– Aging review monthly; align with collections cadence.  
– Document approvals for write‑offs and relief claims.
