## When a credit becomes a refund (vs carry-forward)
Credits arise when input VAT exceeds output VAT. Exporters and zero-rated suppliers are most likely to qualify. GRA requires the prescribed application form and supporting evidence; some credits may be carried forward depending on policy and eligibility.

## How to apply (quick steps)
1) Confirm eligibility (e.g., zero-rated activity/export support).
2) Complete Application for VAT Refund & Tax Relief and attach schedules.
3) Include your VAT return for the period and payment status.
4) Submit via the channel indicated by GRA.
5) Respond promptly to GRA queries with a named contact.

## Evidence pack - what reviewers look for
- VAT return; output/input summaries; bank proof of VAT payments/refunds.
- Sales & purchase listings; verify rates (14% / 0% / exempt) and math (use 14/114 for inclusive prices).
- Export proofs (BL/AWB, export entry); Schedule/Act references for zero-rated items.
- Reconciliations to ledgers/POS; explanations for large period swings.
- Prior-period corrections separated and narrated.

## Tips to speed approval
- Label zero-rated/exempt lines clearly; keep invoice sequencing tight.
- Maintain a rolling refund file during the month.
