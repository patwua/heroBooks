This page covers the concept, mechanics, and G$ journals. For policy/templates, see `kb/articles/inventory-bom-policy-templates-caribbean.md`.

## Concept (context)
A bill of materials (BOM) lists components and quantities required to build a finished good. Kitting bundles components for sale as a set without transformation. Costing must capture materials, plus labour/overhead when applicable, so builds reflect true cost.

## G$ journals
Build: Dr Finished goods (rolled-up cost) / Cr Components (materials) / Cr Accrued labour/overhead where applicable.  
Disassembly: Dr Components / Cr Finished goods.
