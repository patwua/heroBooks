## Context
Some differences require your journal; others require the bank to fix their records. Keep a clear log and evidence.

## GY adjustments
Bank fee not recorded: Dr Bank charges / Cr Bank.  
Book miskey (overstated receipt): Dr Cash over/short / Cr Bank.  
Bank error (e.g., wrong amount posted): no journal; contact bank and track resolution.
