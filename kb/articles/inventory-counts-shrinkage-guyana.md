This page focuses on counts and accounting entries. For a downloadable count sheet, see `kb/articles/inventory-count-sheet-template-caribbean.md`.

## Counting strategy
Cycle counts for A/B/C classes; annual full count to reset the baseline and test controls. Enforce cut‑off, tag areas, and reconcile variances promptly.

## Accounting for differences (GYD)
Shortage G$42,000: Dr COGS—shrinkage 42,000 / Cr Inventory 42,000.  
Obsolete (NRV 80,000 vs cost 96,000): Dr COGS—write‑down 16,000 / Cr Inventory 16,000.

## Controls that matter
Lock SKU master data; keep bin locations tight; investigate negative stock; review voids/returns patterns.

## Reconciliation quick check
☐ Count sheets agree to adjusted stock cards; ☐ Variances approved; ☐ Write‑downs disclosed; ☐ Supplier returns handled; ☐ NRV evidence on file.
