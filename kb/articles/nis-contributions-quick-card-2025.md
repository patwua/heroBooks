### Rates & ceiling
- **Employee** **5.6%**, **Employer** **8.4%** → **14% total**.  
- **Insurable earnings ceiling**: **G$280,000/month** (or **G$64,615/week**).  

### Mini example (monthly)
Salary **G$300,000** → insurable limited to **G$280,000** →  
Employee NIS **5.6%** = **G$15,680**; Employer NIS **8.4%** = **G$23,520**.  
Excess **G$20,000** above ceiling is **not** subject to NIS.
