## Decision tree
1) Does the spend create a new identifiable asset? → **Capex**.  
2) Does it significantly enhance capacity or extend **useful life**? → **Capex**.  
3) Otherwise, it’s likely a **repair/maintenance** expense.

## G$ examples
– Replace engine with higher-spec unit: **Dr PPE 600,000 / Cr Bank 600,000** (capitalize; depreciate).  
– Routine service and oil: **Dr Repairs 25,000 / Cr Bank 25,000** (expense).  
– Roof replacement that extends life: **Dr PPE 900,000 / Cr Bank 900,000**.

## Notes
– Keep invoices/quotes to support the assessment.  
– Be consistent with your **capitalisation threshold** and document it.  
– Update depreciation schedules after capital projects.
