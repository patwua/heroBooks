This page sets policy/KPIs. For G$ journals, see `kb/articles/wip-variances-journals-gyd.md`.

## Policy
Define acceptable ranges, approval thresholds, and routing for root-cause (rate reset, process change, scrap control).

## KPIs
Overhead variance % of absorbed OH; scrap rate by BOM; yield variance %; closure time.

## CSV
`period, job_id, variance_type, amount, root_cause, action, owner, closed_on`
