  - question: When do I open a suspense account?
    answer: Only when the trial balance totals don’t agree and you need a temporary plug so you can keep investigating. Close it fully once errors are found.
    type: faq
  - question: What errors keep the TB balanced?
    answer: Errors of omission, commission, principle, original entry, or compensating errors. These won’t create a TB difference, so no suspense is needed—fix with proper journals.

## Fast diagnosis flow
1) Re‑cast TB totals. 2) Look for obvious sign flips. 3) If still out, create a temporary suspense for the difference to allow continued checks. 4) Test common culprits: one‑sided postings, duplicated entries, transpositions (difference divisible by 9).

## Worked example A — one‑sided posting (GYD)
TB off by G$90,000 (debits exceed credits). You find a motor vehicle purchase Dr G$90,000 posted, but the Cr to Bank missing.  
Fix: Post Cr Bank 90,000; Dr Suspense 90,000 / Cr Bank 90,000 if you had opened suspense initially, then Dr Bank 90,000 / Cr Suspense 90,000 to close. Final suspense balance 0.

## Worked example B — transposition error
Sales ledger entry G$54,800 booked as G$58,400. Difference G$3,600 (divisible by 9).  
Fix: Dr Sales 3,600 / Cr Suspense 3,600 to reverse the overstatement, then close suspense when all items identified.

## Journals you’ll use repeatedly
• To open suspense: Dr/Cr Suspense for the TB difference.  
• To correct mispost: reverse the wrong entry, post the right one.  
• To close suspense: post the balancing entry to Suspense to bring it to nil.

## Documentation
Attach screenshots of the ledger, mark evidence of the error, and keep a short narrative (“who/what/when/why”) next to the correcting journal. This makes audits easier and internal reviews faster.
