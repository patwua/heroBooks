  - question: Which method should I use?
    answer: The method must reflect the pattern in which the asset’s economic benefits are consumed. Straight-line is common; reducing balance may fit assets that lose value faster early on.
    type: howto
  - question: Do I need to review lives/methods?
    answer: Yes — review useful life, residual value, and method annually and adjust prospectively if estimates change.

## What depreciation is (and isn’t)
Depreciation is the **systematic allocation** of an asset’s depreciable amount over its **useful life**. It’s **not** about funding replacement; it’s about measuring the expense that matches the benefit consumed each period.

## Choosing a method
Pick a method that matches **how benefits are consumed**:
- **Straight-line** — even consumption over time (e.g., office furniture).  
- **Reducing balance** — higher usage/obsolescence early (e.g., computers).  
- **Units-of-production** — based on output or hours (e.g., machinery).

## Small GYD examples
Asset cost **G$600,000**, residual **G$60,000**, useful life **5 years**.

**Straight-line**  
Depreciable amount = 600,000 − 60,000 = **540,000** → **G$108,000/yr**

**Reducing balance (30%)**  
Year 1: **30% × 600,000 = G$180,000** (closing 420,000)  
Year 2: **30% × 420,000 = G$126,000** (closing 294,000)  
… continue until carrying amount approaches residual (**G$60,000**).

## Annual review checklist
1) Useful life still reasonable? Technology/usage changed?  
2) Residual value still supportable?  
3) Method still reflects the **consumption pattern**? If not, **change prospectively** and disclose.  
4) Indicators of **impairment**? If yes, test and adjust separately.

## Presentation & notes
- Show depreciation in profit or loss; present PPE by **class** with opening balance, additions, depreciation, disposals, and closing balance.  
- Disclose **methods**, **useful lives/rates**, and **reconciliation** of carrying amounts.

## In heroBooks
- Set method and rate per asset; the system posts **monthly depreciation** automatically.  
- Reports include PPE roll-forward and the depreciation expense by class.
