## What the syllabus requires
For **partnerships**, candidates should understand features of the partnership, the **appropriation account**, and how to prepare **capital** and **current accounts**. Profit-sharing bases include **equal**, **fixed percentage**, or **capital ratio**; the **current account** records partners’ salaries, **interest on capital**, **interest on drawings**, and the **share of profit or loss**.  
> Reference: CXC PoA syllabus — Section “Accounting for Partnerships”.  

## Key ideas in plain English
- **Appropriation account** starts from **net profit** and shows how it’s divided **between partners**.  
- **Partners’ salaries** and **interest on capital** are **appropriations of profit** (not expense to the business).  
- **Drawings** reduce each partner’s **current account**; the business may **charge interest on drawings**.  
- **Capital accounts** (fixed vs fluctuating): with a **fixed capital** system, permanent capital stays in the capital account and routine items go to the **current account**.

## Mini example (GYD)
Two partners, **Ali** and **Beharry**, share profits **3:2**. Data for the year (GYD):  
- Net profit (before appropriations): **G$900,000**  
- Partners’ salaries: Ali **G$120,000**, Beharry **G$60,000**  
- Interest on capital: Ali **G$45,000**, Beharry **G$30,000**  
- Interest on drawings: Ali **G$10,000**, Beharry **G$8,000**  

**Appropriation account (extract)**  
Net profit .............................................. 900,000  
Add: Interest on drawings (A 10,000, B 8,000) ............ 18,000  
Total for appropriation ................................... 918,000  
Less: Salaries (A 120,000, B 60,000) ..................... 180,000  
Less: Interest on capital (A 45,000, B 30,000) ............ 75,000  
Balance to share .......................................... 663,000  
Share of profit (3:2): A **397,800**; B **265,200**

Each partner’s **current account** will show:  
Opening balance (if any) → +Salary → +Interest on Capital → +Share of Profit → −Drawings → −Interest on Drawings → **Closing balance**.

## Quick checks
1) Does the profit-sharing basis match the agreement (equal / % / capital ratio)?  
2) Are partners’ salaries & interest on capital treated as **appropriations**, not expenses?  
3) Are drawings charged with interest (if specified) and posted to the current account?  

## Practice prompt
Prepare the partners’ **current accounts** (columnar form) using the figures above and bring down the balances.
