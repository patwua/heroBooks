This page focuses on drawings (equity). For loans vs drawings, see `kb/articles/owner-loans-vs-drawings-guyana-sme.md`.

## Core idea
For sole traders and partnerships, owner withdrawals (**drawings**) are **distributions of equity**, not expenses. They **reduce capital** and **do not** affect profit or VAT. Record them cleanly to avoid misstating results.

## G$ examples
**Cash draw:** Dr **Drawings – Owner** 150,000 / Cr **Bank** 150,000.  
**Goods withdrawn for personal use:** Dr **Drawings – Owner** 30,000 / Cr **Inventory** 30,000.  
**Year-end close:** Dr **Capital** 180,000 / Cr **Drawings – Owner** 180,000 (transfer to capital).

## Partnerships
Partner “salaries”, interest on capital, and profit shares are part of the **appropriation** of profit — not operating expenses. Use **current/capital** accounts per the partnership agreement.

## Don’ts
– Don’t code drawings to **wages** or **repairs**.  
– Don’t claim input VAT on purely **personal** items.  
– Avoid frequent cash withdrawals without a simple memo trail.
