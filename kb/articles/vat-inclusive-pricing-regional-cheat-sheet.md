This page is regional. For 14% examples, see `kb/articles/vat-inclusive-pricing-7-57-cheat-sheet-guyana.md`.

## Formula
VAT = Gross × r/(100+r).  
Net = Gross − VAT.  
Example (r = 17.5%): Gross 117.50 → VAT 117.50 × 17.5/117.5 = 17.50; Net 100.00.

## Multi-line invoices
You may compute per line then sum, or compute at invoice level. Be consistent with rounding and disclose your policy.

## Rounding
Choose line-level or invoice-level rounding; ensure VAT totals reconcile to the return.
