## Email scripts (short forms)
– Day‑1: "Hi [Name], attached is invoice [#] for [Amount]. Could you confirm receipt? Payment link: [link]. Thanks!"
– Day‑7: "Hi [Name], following up on invoice [#]. Can we set a payment date this week?"

## Call script (promise‑to‑pay)
1) Confirm invoice(s) and amount.  
2) Ask for a payment date and method.  
3) Log the promise and send a recap email.

## Write‑off policy outline (brief)
– Criteria: after reasonable collection efforts, immaterial balances, or debtor liquidation.
