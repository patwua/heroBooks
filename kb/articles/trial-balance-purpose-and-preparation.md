## What a trial balance does (and doesn’t) do
A TB lists ledger balances in **debit/credit** columns to test equality. It is an **internal** control step: crucial for accuracy, yet it **cannot** detect every error (e.g., an entire missing entry). Use it as a checkpoint in your period-end routine, not as proof of perfection.

## Types and timing
- **Unadjusted TB** — extracted before adjustments; used to plan period-end journals.  
- **Adjusted TB** — after adjustments; forms the basis for the **financial statements**.  
- **Post-closing TB** — after closing income/expense to retained earnings; only permanent accounts remain.

## Quick prep checklist
1) Export balances from your ledger as at the period end. 2) Scan for **obvious sign flips** (negative assets). 3) Confirm **debits = credits**. 4) Post the standard adjustments: inventory, accruals/prepayments, depreciation, income tax estimates. 5) Re-extract as an **adjusted TB**. 6) After statements, **close** temporary accounts and produce a **post-closing TB**.

## Mini example (GYD)
Unadjusted debits total **G$18,524,000**; credits **G$18,494,000**. You discover **G$30,000** bank charges posted to income. Correct: **Dr Bank Fees 30,000 / Cr Sales 30,000**. Debits now equal credits; proceed with adjustments.

## Common pitfalls
- Confusing **post-closing** with **adjusted** TB.  
- Leaving suspense balances uninvestigated.  
- Not re-running the TB after posting adjustment journals.
