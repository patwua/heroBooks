This page compares GRA (tax) vs NIS (social insurance) treatment. For a quick Guyana overview, see `kb/articles/payroll-statutory-deductions-guyana-overview-2025.md`.

## Scope snapshot
- GRA (PAYE): income tax on chargeable income per bands/thresholds; taxable benefits/allowances per current rules; monthly withholding and remittance.
- NIS: employee and employer contributions on insurable earnings, with ceilings and categories; separate remittance and reporting.

## G$ worked example (illustrative)
Gross salary 220,000; taxable allowance 10,000; non-taxable travel reimbursement 12,000 (per receipts).  
- PAYE base (GRA): 230,000; compute tax per current bands/thresholds.  
- NIS base: include insurable earnings up to the ceiling; compute EE/ER shares; confirm current rates at NIS.

## Allowances & benefits
- Taxable for PAYE? Check GRA guidance (cash allowances commonly taxable).  
- Insurable for NIS? Check NIS categories and ceilings.  
- Non-taxable reimbursements require receipts and policy.

## Filing & payments
- GRA: monthly PAYE return/payment; year-end certificates; penalties for late/underpayment.
- NIS: monthly contributions schedule/payment; employee registration and updates.

## Evidence & audit readiness
- Maintain payrun reconciliations (gross to net), rate tables/config snapshots, allowance policy, and signed timesheets or contracts.  
- Keep separate proof of NIS calculations and ceilings applied.  
- Reconcile remittances to bank and ledgers.
