## Context
Good customers + clear limits reduce bad debts and rework. A simple onboarding workflow prevents disputes and aligns collections.

## Steps
Application → KYC checks → Reference checks → Set limits/terms → Approve → Configure in system (limits, holds, statements).

## G$ configuration
Credit limit per customer; payment terms; dunning cadence; statement cycle; hold on overdue accounts.
