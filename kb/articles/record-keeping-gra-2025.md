### Keep (at minimum)
- **Sales invoices** (tax invoices) & credit/debit notes  
- **Purchases** (VAT on inputs)  
- **Cash book / bank statements** & reconciliations  
- **Payroll**: PAYE & NIS schedules  
- **Stock**: counts and valuation workings  

### Retention
Retain records to support VAT returns and assessments per GRA guidance and regulations; ensure records are **kept in Guyana** and available to GRA on request.
