## Setup the float (GYD)
Decide a fixed float, e.g., **G$20,000**.  
Journal: **Dr Petty cash 20,000 / Cr Bank 20,000**.

## Using the fund
Every payment needs a **voucher** with date, description, amount, and receipt. Record expenses immediately: e.g., **Dr Stationery 1,200 / Cr Petty cash 1,200**.

## Reimbursement
When cash on hand is, say, **G$5,300**, vouchers total **G$14,700**. Reimburse: **Dr Petty cash 14,700 / Cr Bank 14,700** to bring the box back to **G$20,000**.

## Controls that matter
– Lock the tin; assign a custodian; reconcile vouchers to cash-on-hand frequently.  
– Manager approval for vouchers; avoid splitting invoices to bypass limits.  
– No IOUs or salary advances from petty cash.
