### Deadline
Your VAT return is **due by the 21st of the month** following the tax period (move to the next business day if the 21st is a holiday).  

### How to file (quick)
1) Generate the **VAT Summary** in heroBooks (Sales → Reports → VAT).  
2) Verify **outputs vs inputs** and attach any required schedules.  
3) File via the GRA channel indicated (form/office or e-services).  

### Checks before you submit
- Invoices meet **VAT invoice** requirements.  
- Zero-rated and exempt lines are correct.  
- If you advertised VAT-inclusive prices, reconcile using **7/57** when needed.  

### After filing
Keep proof of filing/payment. Retain books/records in English and in **Guyana dollars** as required.
