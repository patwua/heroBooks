This page covers methods and estimate changes. For a quick register layout, see `kb/articles/fixed-asset-register-quick-start.md`.

## Methods and examples (GYD)
– Straight-line (SL): Computer G$240,000, 36 months → G$6,667/month.  
– Reducing-balance (RB 25%): Vehicle G$3,600,000 → Year‑1 G$900,000.

## Estimate changes
Reassess useful life and residual annually. Changes are **prospective**; adjust remaining depreciation going forward.

## Disclosures
– Method(s) used and useful lives/rates.  
– Nature of any **changes in estimates** and reasons.  
– Effects on depreciation expense for the current period.
