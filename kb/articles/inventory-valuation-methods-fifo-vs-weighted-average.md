  - question: Which cost formulas are allowed?
    answer: Under IFRS for SMEs / IAS 2, you may use FIFO or weighted-average (and specific identification for unique items). LIFO is not permitted.
    type: definition
  - question: How do I pick one?
    answer: Prefer FIFO when prices are rising and stock turns quickly; prefer weighted-average for high-volume, indistinguishable items. Apply the same method to inventories of similar nature and use.

## Cost components (what "cost" includes)
Purchase price (less discounts), import duties, freight, and conversion costs (a share of production overheads). Abnormal waste, storage after production, and selling costs are expensed (not inventory).

## GYD mini-scenario
Purchases of Item A:
- Jan 10: 100 @ G$1,000 = G$100,000
- Jan 25: 60 @ G$1,200 = G$72,000
Sales in Jan: 120 units.

### FIFO
COGS = 100x1,000 + 20x1,200 = G$124,000.
Ending inventory = remaining 40x1,200 = G$48,000.

### Weighted-average (periodic)
Total cost 172,000 / total units 160 = G$1,075 per unit.
COGS = 120x1,075 = G$129,000; Ending inventory = 40x1,075 = G$43,000.

## NRV (lower of cost and NRV)
If expected selling price less costs to sell is G$1,050 per unit at period end, NRV of the 40 units = G$42,000.
Under IAS 2/IFRS for SMEs, carry inventory at lower of cost and NRV - write down G$1,000 (from cost G$43,000 to NRV G$42,000).

## Method discipline
- Use one method for similar inventories; change only with a clear improvement in reliability/relevance and disclose the change.
- Document assumptions; keep vendor invoices and landed-cost workings.
