This page provides context, G$ examples, and config tips. For a regional policy matrix, see `kb/articles/payroll-allowances-policy-matrix-caribbean.md`.

## Context — PAYE vs NIS
GRA’s PAYE taxes chargeable income (cash allowances are often taxable; reimbursements with receipts are generally not). NIS contributions apply to insurable earnings and may include some allowances up to ceilings. Classify each category explicitly and keep policy evidence.

## Examples (illustrative)
Cash allowance (taxable, insurable): include in PAYE/NIS bases.  
Reimbursement with receipts (non‑taxable): exclude from PAYE/NIS; keep proof.  
Benefit in kind: assess per GRA rules; include where required.
