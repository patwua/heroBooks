## Register as an employer
- Obtain an **Employer Registration** with NIS (company details, address, officers, bank info).  
- Onboard employees with their NIS numbers and keep payroll records ready for audits.

## Contribution rates & ceiling
- **Employee 5.6%** + **Employer 8.4%** = **14% total**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Insurable earnings ceiling**: **G$280,000/month** (or **G$64,615/week**). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

### Worked example (monthly)
Salary **G$300,000** → insurable capped at **G$280,000** →  
Employee NIS = **5.6% × 280,000 = G$15,680**; Employer NIS = **8.4% × 280,000 = G$23,520**.  
Excess **G$20,000** above the ceiling is **not** subject to NIS.

## Monthly remittance routine
1) **Calculate** per the ceiling and split.  
2) **Deduct** employee 5.6% from net pay; **accrue** employer 8.4% as expense.  
3) **Remit** to NIS with schedules by the required deadline; keep receipts.  
4) Reconcile payroll control accounts monthly.
