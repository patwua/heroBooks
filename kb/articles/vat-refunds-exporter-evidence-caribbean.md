This page focuses on a regional exporter evidence pack. For Guyana specifics (forms, policy), see `kb/articles/vat-refunds-evidence-pack-guyana.md`.

## Exporter evidence pack (core items)
– VAT return and period selection; refund request amount.  
– Sales summary split by 0% exports and domestic.  
– Purchase VAT summary with high-value invoices listed.  
– Export proof: bill of lading/air waybill, customs export entry, commercial invoice.  
– Reconciliations: sales to ledgers/POS, purchases to AP; narrative for large swings.

## Sample cover letter (adapt)
> We request a VAT refund of [G$/X$] for [period]. The enclosed pack includes: (1) VAT return and ledgers bridge; (2) invoice listings; (3) export proofs; (4) bank proofs; and (5) explanations for variances and prior-period adjustments. Contact: [Name, phone, email].

## Tips
– Keep invoice numbering tight; label zero-rated lines clearly.  
– Extract VAT from inclusive amounts using the jurisdiction’s rate (e.g., **14/114**).  
– Maintain a running refund file during the month.
