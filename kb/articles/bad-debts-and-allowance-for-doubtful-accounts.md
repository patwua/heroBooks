  - question: Does IFRS for SMEs use expected credit loss (ECL)?
    answer: No. Section 11 uses an incurred-loss impairment approach for financial assets at cost or amortised cost. Recognise impairment when there is objective evidence a loss event occurred (e.g., default, significant financial difficulty).

      Write-off: Dr Allowance / Cr Trade receivables.

## What counts as “objective evidence”?
Common indicators include significant delinquency (e.g., >90 days past due), debtor bankruptcy/insolvency, or adverse changes in payment status. Under Section 11 you assess individually significant receivables individually, and the rest collectively (e.g., aging buckets).  

### A simple aging-bucket method (example, G$)
Assume trade receivables **G$10,500,000**:  

| Bucket | Balance | % Loss | Expected loss |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Current | 6,000,000 | 1% | 60,000 |
| 31–60 days | 2,500,000 | 4% | 100,000 |
| 61–90 days | 1,500,000 | 12% | 180,000 |
| >90 days | 500,000 | 40% | 200,000 |
| **Total** | **10,500,000** |  | **540,000** |

If last year’s allowance was **G$420,000**, the **increase** is **G$120,000**:  
**Dr Impairment expense 120,000 / Cr Allowance 120,000**.  

### Writing off a specific debtor (after collection efforts)
When a G$80,000 balance is deemed uncollectible:  
**Dr Allowance 80,000 / Cr Trade receivables 80,000**.  
If later recovered **G$20,000**: **Dr Cash 20,000 / Cr Impairment recovery 20,000**.

## Documentation & controls
- Keep aged receivables reports and collection notes.  
- Maintain a short credit policy (limits, terms, stop-supply triggers).  
- Review top 10 customers monthly; re-age and re-assess allowance rates at quarter-end.  
- Separate write-off approval from collection duties.

## VAT note (Guyana)
VAT is generally tied to tax invoices and supplies (time-of-supply rules). A bad-debt write-off does not itself create VAT, but VAT adjustments may apply where output tax was recognised and the debt becomes irrecoverable—confirm against current GRA guidance.
