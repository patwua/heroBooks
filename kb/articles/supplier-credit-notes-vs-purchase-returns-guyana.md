This page covers requirements and AP control points. For postings/templates, see `kb/articles/supplier-credit-notes-postings-regional.md`.

## When to use what
- Price adjustment/overcharge → Supplier credit note.  
- Damaged/incorrect goods returned → Physical return plus supplier credit note referencing the original invoice.  
- Quantity short-delivered → Debit/credit as per agreement; document the correction.

## VAT and records
Ensure the supplier credit note references the original tax invoice and shows the correct VAT rate/amount. Keep the note with your AP voucher trail; reconcile notes to VAT return boxes and the purchases ledger.

## AP controls
- Separate sequencing for notes; manager approval thresholds.  
- Three-way match (PO/GRN/invoice) and note linkage; update inventory where returns occur.  
- Period cut‑off: date the note in the correct period.

## Templates
Credit note templates: `/kb/templates/credit-note-template.csv`, `/kb/templates/credit-note-template.txt`.
