### Key rules (2025)
- **Personal allowance**: **G$1,560,000** per year **or** **1/3 of income**, whichever is higher.  
- **Tax bands**: **25%** up to **G$3,120,000** (i.e., G$260,000 monthly); **35%** on the excess.  
- **Child allowance**: **G$120,000 per year** per child (cap **G$10,000/mo** each).  
- **Overtime**: non-taxable up to **G$600,000/yr** (cap **G$50,000/mo**).  

### Mini example (monthly)
Gross **G$280,000**; NIS (employee) **5.6%** = **G$15,680**; Personal allowance **G$130,000** → Chargeable **G$134,320** → **25%** band applies.  

> Note: Apply NIS employee deduction before computing chargeable income.
