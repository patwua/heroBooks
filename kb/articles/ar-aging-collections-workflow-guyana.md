This page focuses on workflow and KPIs. For scripts and a write‑off policy, see `kb/articles/ar-collections-scripts-writeoff-policy.md`.

## Prioritize by risk
Buckets: Current / 1–30 / 31–60 / 61–90 / 90+. Focus on 31–60 and 90+; watch large balances.

## Cadence
Day‑1 reminder → Day‑7 follow‑up → Day‑14 call/promise‑to‑pay → Day‑21 manager escalation → Day‑30 hold/stop‑ship.

## Write‑offs
After documented efforts and approval, write‑off or adjust allowance per policy; disclose material items.
