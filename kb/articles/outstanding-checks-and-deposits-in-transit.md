## Spotting the timing differences
- **Outstanding cheques**: issued/recorded by you, **not** yet shown on the bank statement.  
- **Deposits in transit**: recorded by you, **not** yet credited on the bank statement.  
These are **timing items**, not errors; the purpose of reconciliation is to adjust the bank-statement balance to the **true** cash balance at period end (concept basis from IFRS for SMEs). :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}

## Where to show them
- Adjust the **bank side** of the reconciliation:  
  - **+ Deposits in transit**  
  - **– Outstanding cheques**

## Worked example (GYD)
Bank statement shows **G$1,220,000**; cash book shows **G$1,250,000**.  
Timing: **Deposits in transit G$30,000**; **Outstanding cheques G$60,000**; bank charges **G$5,000** (not yet posted).  
- Adjusted bank = 1,220,000 **+ 30,000 − 60,000 = G$1,190,000**  
- Post the **bank charges** (Dr Bank Charges 5,000 | Cr Cash 5,000) → adjusted cash book **G$1,245,000**  
Investigate the remaining difference — likely a posting error or omitted receipt.

**Illustration (1:1):** A small T-diagram labelled “Bank Rec” with arrows for +Deposits in transit and −Outstanding cheques and a note “charges/interest → post to cash book”.
