  - question: What is the accounting equation?
    answer: The accounting equation states that Assets = Liabilities + Equity. It must hold after every transaction; it’s the basis of double-entry and the balance sheet.
    type: definition
  - question: How do debits and credits relate to the equation?
    answer: Debits increase assets and expenses; credits increase equity, income, and liabilities. Every transaction posts equal debits and credits to keep A = L + E.
    type: howto
  - question: Why does the equation matter for PoA and heroBooks?
    answer: It underpins the balance sheet tested in CXC PoA and ensures your ledger stays in balance in heroBooks after every journal or document you post.

## What the equation says (and why it never “breaks”)
The **accounting equation** is:

> **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

It must hold **after every transaction**—not just at month-end. This is the core of double-entry bookkeeping taught in **CSEC Principles of Accounts** and used in practice to present a statement of financial position (balance sheet). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### The building blocks (IFRS for SMEs terms)
- **Assets**: present economic resources controlled by the entity as a result of past events (e.g., cash, inventory, receivables).  
- **Liabilities**: present obligations to transfer an economic resource as a result of past events (e.g., loans, payables).  
- **Equity**: residual interest in the assets after deducting liabilities (owner’s capital, retained profit).  
These definitions come from **IFRS for SMEs (2025), Section 2**. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Debits, credits, and the equation
- **Debits (Dr)** increase **Assets** (and Expenses); **Credits (Cr)** increase **Liabilities**, **Equity** (and Income).  
- Every transaction records **equal** debits and credits. That equality is what keeps **A = L + E** true at all times.

## Worked example (GYD)
Keisha starts a small service business in Georgetown:

1. Owner invests **G$600,000** cash.  
   - Dr Cash 600,000 | Cr Owner’s Capital 600,000  
   - Equation: **Assets 600,000 = Liabilities 0 + Equity 600,000**

2. Business takes a **bank loan G$300,000**.  
   - Dr Cash 300,000 | Cr Bank Loan (Liability) 300,000  
   - Equation: **Assets 900,000 = Liabilities 300,000 + Equity 600,000**

3. Buys **inventory G$180,000** on credit.  
   - Dr Inventory 180,000 | Cr Accounts Payable 180,000  
   - Equation: **Assets 1,080,000 = Liabilities 480,000 + Equity 600,000**

4. Sells goods for **G$240,000** on credit; cost **G$120,000**.  
   - Dr Accounts Receivable 240,000 | Cr Sales (Income→Equity) 240,000  
   - Dr Cost of Sales 120,000 | Cr Inventory 120,000  
   - Net effect: Assets +120,000 (A/R ↑ 240,000; Inventory ↓ 120,000); Equity +120,000 (Profit).  
   - Equation: **Assets 1,200,000 = Liabilities 480,000 + Equity 720,000**

5. Pays supplier **G$100,000** toward the payable.  
   - Dr Accounts Payable 100,000 | Cr Cash 100,000  
   - Equation: **Assets 1,100,000 = Liabilities 380,000 + Equity 720,000**

Final balances still satisfy **A = L + E**. If your books don’t, a posting is missing or misclassified.

## Common pitfalls & quick checks
- **Single-sided posting**: every journal must have **Dr = Cr** totals.  
- **Misclassifying owner drawings** as expenses (drawings reduce **Equity**, not an expense).  
- **Confusing revenue with cash**: credit sales increase **Assets (A/R)** and **Equity (income)** even before cash arrives.  
- **Inventory**: selling inventory reduces **Assets** (inventory) and increases **Expenses** (cost of sales), affecting **Equity**.

### Two 30-second tests
1) Trial balance **debits = credits**? If not, the equation will fail.  
2) Rebuild the balance sheet: does **Assets − Liabilities = Equity**? If not, trace back the last batch of entries.

## In heroBooks
- All sales, purchases, receipts, and journal entries are **double-entry**.  
- The **dashboard and balance sheet** reflect the equation automatically; if a posting is incomplete, you’ll see it immediately in the trial balance.
