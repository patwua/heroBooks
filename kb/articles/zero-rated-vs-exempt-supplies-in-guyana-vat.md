  - question: What’s the difference between zero-rated and exempt?
    answer: Zero-rated is a taxable supply at 0% (usually allows input VAT recovery); exempt is non-taxable (input VAT not recoverable). See this article for examples and invoicing notes.
    type: definition
  - question: What should my invoice say?
    answer: Tag each line explicitly as “Zero-rated” or “Exempt” and follow the Tax Invoice fields GRA lists (or Sales Invoice where permitted). See the “Invoice & label rules” section.

## Plain-English definitions
- **Zero-rated** = taxable at **0%**. You still treat it as VAT-able; typically you may **recover input VAT** on related purchases, and zero-rated sales count toward refund claims if they dominate your outputs. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Exempt** = **non-taxable**. You do **not** charge VAT; related input VAT is **not recoverable** (unless you operate a partial-exemption method for mixed supplies). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

> Guyana’s standard VAT rate is 14% (used for standard-rated items; not for zero-rated or exempt). For invoice details see GRA’s VAT invoice guidance and the Act/Regs. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Typical examples (always verify current lists)
- **Zero-rated**: Selected foods/commodities and items listed in **Schedule I** (GRA Zero-Rated page contains the current list and updates). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Exempt**: Financial services and other items listed in **Schedule II** (GRA Exempt page). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Invoice & label rules that matter
When issuing a **Tax Invoice**, include all particulars and **label zero-rated and exempt lines** clearly. These particulars are set out by GRA and in the VAT Act/Regs (e.g., the words **“Tax Invoice”**, supplier details, description, serial number, VAT amount/total). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Accounting impact (refunds & input VAT)
- **Zero-rated sales** → generally **input VAT recoverable**; heavy zero-rated outputs can lead to **excess input credits** (refund claims). Check GRA guidance and maintain documentation. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Exempt sales** → **input VAT not recoverable**; build the cost into pricing. If you sell a **mix**, apply **partial exemption** rules. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

### Quick checks before filing VAT
1) Are zero-rated and exempt lines **explicitly tagged** on invoices? :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
2) Have you **excluded** input VAT tied to exempt supplies (or applied your method)? :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
