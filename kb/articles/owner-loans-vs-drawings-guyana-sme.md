This page focuses on loans vs drawings. For drawings as equity distributions, see `kb/articles/owner-withdrawals-vs-expenses.md`.

## Drawings vs loans (quick view)
Drawings (sole trader/partners): reduce **capital/current** accounts.  
Loans: amounts **due from/to** the owner/director → show as **receivable/payable** on the balance sheet, not in profit or loss.

## Clean G$ postings
– Cash drawings: Dr Drawings 150,000 / Cr Bank 150,000 → year‑end transfer Dr Capital / Cr Drawings.  
– Loan from owner to business: Dr Bank 500,000 / Cr Loan — Owner 500,000.  
– Repayment: Dr Loan — Owner 200,000 / Cr Bank 200,000.  
– Company DLA (director owes company): Dr Directors’ Loan 75,000 / Cr Bank 75,000; charge interest if agreed.

## Pitfalls
– Coding drawings to **wages/repairs** (distorts profit, VAT).  
– Letting a director’s loan drift without terms — document **repayment/interest**.  
– Mixing personal and business expenses in one card; keep a simple memo trail.
