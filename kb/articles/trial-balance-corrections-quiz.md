  - question: How do I use a suspense account properly?
    answer: Only to park the TB difference while you investigate; then fully clear it by posting the identified fixes. Keep a short narrative with each correcting journal.

> **How to use this page**  
Try each scenario first. Then expand “Answer & reasoning” to review the journal(s) and why they work.

### Q1 — One-sided posting (G$90,000)
Equipment purchase Dr **90,000** was posted; the Cr to Bank is missing. TB shows Debits > Credits by **90,000**.  
**Answer & reasoning:** Post **Cr Bank 90,000**. If you opened suspense initially, do **Dr Suspense 90,000 / Cr Bank 90,000**, then close **Dr Bank 90,000 / Cr Suspense 90,000**.

### Q2 — Transposition
Sales **54,800** recorded as **58,400**; TB difference **3,600** (divisible by **9**).  
**Answer & reasoning:** **Dr Sales 3,600 / Cr Suspense 3,600** to remove the overstatement; close suspense once all items are fixed.

### Q3 — Error of principle
G$120,000 spent on **machinery overhaul** capital in nature was posted to **Repairs expense**. TB balances.  
**Answer & reasoning:** **Dr PPE 120,000 / Cr Repairs 120,000**. No suspense needed because TB already balanced (principle error).

### Q4 — Omission
Rent **G$60,000** not recorded at all; TB still balances.  
**Answer & reasoning:** **Dr Rent 60,000 / Cr Bank 60,000** (or Payables if unpaid). No suspense — omissions don’t create TB differences.

### Q5 — Duplicate entry
Bank charges **G$4,000** posted twice.  
**Answer & reasoning:** **Dr Suspense 4,000 / Cr Bank charges 4,000** if you initially parked the difference; otherwise **Dr Bank 4,000 / Cr Bank charges 4,000** to reverse.

### Q6 — Reversal of entries
Customer receipt **G$75,000** posted as **Dr Receivables / Cr Cash**.  
**Answer & reasoning:** Reverse and repost: **Dr Cash 75,000 / Cr Receivables 75,000**.

### Q7 — Wrong side, correct account
Wages **G$30,000** posted **Cr Wages**.  
**Answer & reasoning:** **Dr Wages 60,000 / Cr Suspense 60,000** if a suspense was opened; alternatively **Dr Wages 30,000 / Cr Wages 30,000** (to reverse) then **Dr Wages 30,000 / Cr Bank 30,000** (correct).

### Q8 — Miscast sales day book
Sales day book totaled **G$1,254,000** instead of **G$1,245,000**.  
**Answer & reasoning:** **Dr Sales 9,000 / Cr Suspense 9,000** (reduce overcast).

### Q9 — Posting to wrong ledger
Supplier payment **G$48,000** posted to **Sales**.  
**Answer & reasoning:** **Dr Purchases 48,000 / Cr Sales 48,000** (reclass) plus cash/bank if also misposted there.

### Q10 — Clearing suspense
After fixes, suspense shows **Cr 6,400**.  
**Answer & reasoning:** Post **Dr Suspense 6,400 / Cr appropriate account(s)** once you locate the final error; suspense must end at **zero**.
