This page focuses on disclosures and note wording. For recognition/journals, see `kb/articles/inventory-write-downs-nrv-reversals-guyana-2025.md`.

## What readers expect to see
At a minimum disclose:  
1) **Cost formula** — FIFO or weighted-average (IFRS does not permit LIFO).  
2) **Write-downs to NRV** recognised as expense, and 3) **reversals** recognised when NRV recovers (not above original cost).  
4) **Carrying amount** by relevant classes (e.g., raw materials, finished goods).  
5) **Basis for NRV** estimates (selling prices, costs to sell).

## Short note template (no write-downs)
> Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the **weighted-average** method. As at 31 December 2025, inventories comprise finished goods of G$4.2m and raw materials of G$1.1m. No write-downs were recognised in the period.

## Expanded note (write-down and partial reversal)
During 2025, the Group recognised **G$640,000** to write inventories down to NRV for slow-moving SKUs. In Q4 2025, **G$320,000** of that write-down was **reversed** following price recovery; reversals did not increase carrying amounts above original cost. Inventories are measured using **FIFO**. Management determines NRV from observable selling prices and expected costs to sell.

## Practical tips
– Keep evidence of NRV calculations (price lists, recent sales) with the file.  
– Disclose reasons for material write-downs/reversals (seasonality, damage, market fall).  
– Apply one cost formula consistently to similar inventories; disclose if changed and why.
