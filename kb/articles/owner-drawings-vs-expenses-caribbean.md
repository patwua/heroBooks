This page is regional. For G$ examples, see `kb/articles/owner-withdrawals-vs-expenses.md`.

## Core idea
Drawings are equity distributions, not expenses. They don’t affect profit or VAT returns.

## Example entries (generic)
Cash drawing: Dr Drawings / Cr Bank.  
Goods for personal use: Dr Drawings / Cr Inventory.  
Year‑end: Dr Capital / Cr Drawings.

## Partnerships and companies
Partnership drawings appear in current/capital accounts. For companies, use director/owner loan accounts for advances/repayments — see loans guidance.
