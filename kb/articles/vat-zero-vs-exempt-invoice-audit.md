  - question: What must a VAT invoice show in Guyana?
    answer: Supplier details, buyer details, unique **tax invoice** number/date, description, quantity, **VAT rate/amount**, and where relevant a clear **zero-rated** or **exempt** indication, per GRA guidance.
    type: definition
  - question: What’s the audit shortcut?
    answer: Pick a sample, confirm **rate** (14%/0%/exempt), test math (e.g., use **7/57** for VAT-inclusive prices), confirm support (Schedule 1/Act) and that summaries post to the right VAT boxes.

## Quick checklist (tick each)
☐ “**Tax invoice**” wording, unique number, date  
☐ Supplier TIN & address; customer ID if required  
☐ Description/quantity; unit price; **VAT rate** and **amount**  
☐ If **zero-rated** or **exempt**, it’s **explicitly stated**, with evidence (e.g., Schedule 1 item)  
☐ Totals foot; VAT math checks (14% exclusive or **7/57** inclusive)  
☐ Invoice included in VAT returns with correct **output** (and **input** on purchases)

## Worked mini audit (GYD)
Sample: 10 invoices in March. Two show “0%” for exported items; one shows “Exempt — financial service”.  
– **Zero-rated**: confirm export docs; label “0% (Schedule 1)” and amounts in **GYD**.  
– **Exempt**: check service qualifies; ensure **no input VAT claim** on that purchase.  
– Recompute VAT for VAT-inclusive invoice **G$114,000**: output VAT = **114,000 × 14/114 = 14,000**; net sales **100,000**.
