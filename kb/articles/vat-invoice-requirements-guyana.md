  - question: What has to be on a VAT tax invoice in Guyana?
    answer: The words “Tax Invoice” at the top; supplier name, address, VAT number; description; quantity/volume; VAT amount; price before VAT and total incl. VAT; unique serial number; and issue date. See this article for the full list and examples.
    type: definition
  - question: Can I issue a sales invoice instead of a tax invoice?
    answer: Yes—only for small cash sales (≤ G$10,000). The sales invoice must still carry supplier details, description, price, VAT (if shown separately) and issue date.
    type: faq
  - question: How do I back out VAT from a VAT-inclusive price?
    answer: Use the VAT fraction 7/57 (for 14% VAT). Example: G$2,500 × 7/57 = G$307 VAT; price before VAT = G$2,193.

### Required fields on a VAT **Tax Invoice**
By law, every taxable supply (14% or 0%) must show: **“Tax Invoice”**; your **name, address & VAT Registration Number**; **description**; **quantity/volume**; **VAT charged**; **price before VAT** and **total incl. VAT**; a **unique serial number**; and the **issue date**. Mark **zero-rated** lines clearly.  

### When a **Sales Invoice** is allowed
For **cash sales ≤ G$10,000**, a VAT-registered supplier may issue a **sales invoice** instead. It must still carry supplier details, description, **price**, **VAT amount** if shown, and the **issue date**.  

### VAT rate & the **7/57 fraction**
Guyana’s standard VAT is **14%**. If your price is VAT-inclusive, compute the VAT portion using **7/57**. Example: a **G$2,500** VAT-inclusive sale has **G$307 VAT** and **G$2,193 net**.

### Worked example (GYD)
Keisha’s Salon issues a tax invoice:
- Shampoo & style (1) – **G$5,000**  
- Hair mask (1) – **G$2,000**  
- **Subtotal** G$7,000; **VAT (14%)** **G$980**; **Total** **G$7,980**  
Header shows **“Tax Invoice”**, VAT No., serial **HB-2025-000123**, and the issue date.

### In heroBooks
- Sales → **Invoices** → New (compliant header & serial).  
- Settings → **Branding** → set VAT Registration Number.  
- Reports → **VAT Summary** → totals for filing.
