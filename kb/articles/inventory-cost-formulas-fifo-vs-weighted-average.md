## What to pick — and why
– **FIFO**: recent purchases remain in inventory; older costs flow to COGS. In rising prices, FIFO tends to show lower COGS and higher closing inventory.  
– **Weighted-average**: smooths price volatility; COGS and inventory use average costs.

## Mini ledger (GYD)
Start 0 units. Buy **100 @ 1,000**; sell **60**; buy **80 @ 1,200**; sell **50**.  
– FIFO COGS differs from **moving-average** because the timing of receipts/sales determines which costs are issued.  
– Weighted-average (periodic): compute total cost ÷ total units in the period.

## Disclosure
Disclose the **cost formula** used and keep it **consistent** for similar items. Document any changes with reasons (IAS 8).
