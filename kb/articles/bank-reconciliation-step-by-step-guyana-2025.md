### Steps
1) **Get the bank statement** for the period (e.g., Aug 1–31).  
2) **Tick matches** between bank statement and cash book.  
3) Note **timing differences**: outstanding cheques; deposits in transit; bank charges; interest; direct debits/credits.  
4) **Prepare the reconciliation**: Adjust bank or cash-book side to reach the true balance at period end.  
5) **Post journals** for bank charges/interest/fees and any errors found.  

### Worked GYD example
Cash book shows **G$1,250,000**; bank statement shows **G$1,220,000**.  
Outstanding cheques **G$60,000**; deposit in transit **G$30,000**; bank charges **G$5,000** not yet in cash book.  
→ Adjusted bank = 1,220,000 + 30,000 − 60,000 = **G$1,190,000**  
→ Adjust cash book with **G$5,000** bank charges → **G$1,245,000**  
Investigate the remaining **G$55,000** difference — likely an error or omitted receipt.
