This page aggregates official links and guardrails. For a regional overview, see `kb/articles/payroll-statutory-deductions-caribbean-map.md`.

## Guardrails
Rates and bands change. Use configuration and fetch from an external source, with a “Verify” footnote linking to GRA/NIS.

## Common pitfalls
Back‑dated rate changes; not applying caps or ceilings; misclassifying allowances.

## Journal mapping (generic)
Gross wages: Dr Wages / Cr PAYE payable / Cr NIS payable / Cr Cash (net).  
Employer NIS: Dr Staff costs / Cr NIS payable.
