      "a": "The accounting equation states that Assets = Liabilities + Equity. It must hold after every transaction; it’s the basis of double-entry and the balance sheet."

      "q": "How do debits and credits relate to the equation?",
      "a": "Debits increase assets and expenses; credits increase equity, income, and liabilities. Every transaction posts equal debits and credits to keep A = L + E."

      "q": "What are bank rules?",
      "a": "Bank rules automatically suggest or post categories, tax codes, and payees for repeating or similar bank-feed lines (for example, mobile top-ups or fuel). Used well, they reduce manual data entry while keeping a clear audit trail."
