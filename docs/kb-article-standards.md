KB Article Standards (Context → How → Example → Sources)

To keep guides educational (not just examples), use this skeleton:

1) Context (Why this matters)
   - One short section explaining the concept, risks, and relationship to adjacent processes (VAT, NIS, WIP, etc.).

2) How it works (Steps/mechanics)
   - Clear steps or mechanics before examples; include decision points and common pitfalls.

3) Example(s) (G$ where applicable)
   - Worked entries or mini-walkthroughs reinforcing the steps; examples are supportive, not the core narrative.

4) Evidence/Controls (what to retain)
   - What reviewers or auditors expect; how to reconcile and prevent repeat issues.

5) Templates/Downloads
   - CSV/TXT templates and where they fit in the process.

6) See also + Sources
   - Cross-links to A/B counterparts; authoritative sources and verification links.

When creating or uplifting pages, place “Context” above examples and ensure sources are linked. Use A/B intent consistently (A = country mechanics, B = regional policy/templates).
